# Controlling-tablet-screen-and-servo-motors
this repository contains hardware and software description with implementation method for controlling tablet screen and servo motors with ultrasonic sensor and bluetooth module

# Hardware Description
In this task, the circuit has been designed to be composed of a 9V DC voltage source to power the circuit, an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of the standing user, a Bluetooth module to connect the Arduino to the tablet, a microcontroller (Arduino Uno) and six servo motors tom move the robot arms. 

# Implementation 
To construct the circuit, first connect al servos to the power source (9V battery) and take three servo motors and connect them in parallel to pin 7 and the other three to pin 6. In this construction each three motors are controlling one robot arm. Secondly, connect VCC to the battery, GND to ground and the ultrasonic sensorâ€™s pins Trigger and Echo to pins 3 and 2 respectively. Finally, connect the VCC to the battery, GND with ground and the pins TX and RX to the pins 0 and respectively. *Note connect pins TX and RX after powering the circuit to avoid any errors in the signal sent. 

# Programing Description
The circuit was programmed to send a signal to turn on the screen of the tablet and welcome the user via the Bluetooth module (in this case an LED was used), if the user is standing in the parameter of the ultrasonic sensor for 3 seconds. After that, a signal is sent to the motors will move from initial position 0 degrees to 45 degrees to welcome the user and have his attention. However, if there is no user is standing in the parameter of the ultrasonic sensor, the screen will remain off and the servo motors will remain in the initial position.
